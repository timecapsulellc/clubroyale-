# 🇳🇵 Marriage Card Game: Player FAQ & Guide

## How to Play (The Nepali Way)

### ❓ I have valid sets, why can't I see the Joker (Tiplu)?
In Nepali Marriage, the game has two phases. You start in **Phase 1 (Locked)**.
- You play "Blind". You cannot see the Tiplu or use wildcards.
- To unlock the game, you must show **3 Pure Sequences** (e.g. `2♥-3♥-4♥`).
- Once you show these, you "Visit" (Unlock Phase 2) and the Tiplu is revealed!

### ❓ Why can't I pick up a card from the discard pile?
You might be restricted by one of two rules:
1.  **Strict Visiting (Vesting)**: In some lobbies, you cannot pick *any* card from the discard pile until you have "Visited" (Shown 3 pure sets). You must draw from the deck.
2.  **Joker Block**: If the card on the discard pile is a **Joker/Wildcard**, you are not allowed to pick it up. You must draw from the deck.

### ❓ What is "Kidnap"?
If you lose the game without "Visiting" (Showing your 3 pure sets), you get **Kidnapped!**
- This means all the Maal (Value Cards) in your hand are worth **0 points** to you.
- Even worse, the Winner **steals** your points!

### ❓ What is a Tunnel (Tunnela)?
A Tunnel is **3 Identical Cards** (e.g., `8♠-8♠-8♠`).
- It counts as a Pure Sequence for Visiting.
- It is worth **5 Points** (big bonus!).
- *Note:* If you don't visit before the game ends, your Tunnel might be worth 0 (Tunnel Pachaunu rule).

### ❓ How is the score calculated?
Scoring is a mix of Game Points + Maal Points.
1.  **Winner** gets points from every loser (3 pts if you visited, 10 pts if you didn't).
2.  **Maal Exchange**: Look at the value cards you hold. If you have 10 points and your friend has 5, your friend pays you the difference (5 pts). This happens between every player!

## Quick Troubleshooting

- **"Invalid Move"**: You are probably trying to use a Joker in Phase 1, or picking a blocked card.
- **"Game Over - Not Visited"**: You lost the game before showing your pure sets. High penalty!
